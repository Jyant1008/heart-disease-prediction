## Installation

To run this project, you'll need to have Python installed along with several libraries. You can install the necessary libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Heart Disease dataset. Ensure you have the dataset in a CSV format. You can download the dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository or other reliable sources.

Usage
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/heart-disease-prediction.git
Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd heart-disease-prediction
Open the Jupyter Notebook:
bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook "model Accuracy on heart disease dataset Jyant(23572008).ipynb"
Run all the cells in the notebook to train and evaluate the models.
Models Used
Logistic Regression: A linear model for binary classification.
Random Forest Classifier: An ensemble method that uses multiple decision trees.
Gradient Boosting Classifier: An ensemble technique that builds models sequentially and reduces errors.
Evaluation Metrics
The models are evaluated based on the following metrics:

Accuracy Score: The ratio of correctly predicted instances to the total instances.
Confusion Matrix: A table to describe the performance of a classification model.
ROC Curve: A graphical plot illustrating the diagnostic ability of a binary classifier.
Classification Report: A detailed report showing precision, recall, F1-score, and support.
Results
The results section of the notebook contains visualizations and performance metrics for the models used. The project aims to identify the best-performing model for predicting heart disease.
